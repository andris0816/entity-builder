# What I need to do for a World view, where we can check the world's entities and relationships

- Components I need
    - Entity creator form
        - I can create entities with name, type and a description. These new entities will be automatically seen
    - Relationship creator form
        - I can create relationships between entities with a relationship type. Will be seen automatically as well.
    - Entity search
        - This will be a search input, where I can type in entity names, and only the result from the search will be visible in the entity map
        - Has filtering by type
        - Has a reset button, which removes these conditions
    - Entity map
        - This is the place where we will essentially see the world
        - You can zoom in and out, you can move by dragging the cursor
        - Should be an svg maybe
        - Optional: You can set a picture as background
    - Entity
        - Represents single entities on the entity map showing it's name
        - These can be movable, should have some nice animation
    - Relationship
        - Connects the corresponding entities on the entity map
        - Some kind of line with the relationship type written in the middle
    - Entity description
        - Visible on the right side when clicking on an entity
        - Shows the selected entity's information, such as name, description, entity type, tags, relationships it has
        - Has an edit and delete button, which you can use to update or delete
    - Edit modal
        - You can edit entities when click the icon on the description part
